### Introduction to Object-Oriented-Programming for Machine Learning

- Take a close look at the following files:
  - `DataPoint.java`
  - `DataSet.java`

- Take note of the different methods in each.

- Complete Tasks 1-2 in `kNNMain.java`

- commit your changes and show your teacher.

### K-Nearest Neighbors Classification
 - Take a close look at `KNNClassifier.java`
 - what do the different methods do?

 - Complete Tasks 4, 5, and 6 in `kNNMain.java`
  - at the end of each task, commit your changes

## Report: Error Analysis

Now that you understand how to interact with the classes in this project, your final task is to analyse the performance of kNN classification on the `breastCancer.csv` dataset.

Most importantly, we want to characterize
 - the amount of confidence we can put in our model
 - the types of errors that our classifier makes
